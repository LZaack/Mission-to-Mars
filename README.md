# Mission-to-Mars Analysis

Robin's asked me to polish her wep app by adding images of Mars’s hemispheres that we can scrape froma a friendly site. 

She asked me to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. 

To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
